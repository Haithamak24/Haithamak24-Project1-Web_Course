Personal Portfolio Project

Overview
This project is a simple personal portfolio website created as part of a task from a web preparation course. The goal was to design a basic portfolio using only pure HTML, showcasing fundamental skills in document structure and semantic HTML.

Purpose
The primary purpose of this project is to demonstrate my ability to create a structured and navigable website using basic HTML. It provides a platform for potential employers, clients, or collaborators to learn more about me and my work.

Features
Home Page: Introduces the portfolio and includes navigation links to other sections.

About Me Page: Offers a brief overview of my background and interests.

Resume Page: Displays my resume and work experience.

Projects Page: Lists and describes various projects I have worked on. Placeholder images are used for the project visuals.

Contact Me Page: Provides a contact form for visitors to send messages directly.

Technologies Used
HTML: The website is built entirely with HTML. The focus was on using HTML tags effectively to create a well-organized and semantic site.

Why Use HTML?
Document Structure: HTML provides the foundational structure for organizing content on a webpage.
Semantic Elements: HTML5 semantic elements like <header>, <nav>, <section>, and <footer> ensure meaningful organization and accessibility.
Basic Learning: HTML is essential for learning web design and development fundamentals.

Context
This project was a task from a preparation course, and the requirement was to use only pure HTML. It is a straightforward example of a personal portfolio, and the design is intentionally kept simple to align with the course guidelines. Placeholder images are used for project visuals, which will be replaced with actual images in future updates.

Future Plans
In the future, I plan to enhance this portfolio by adding more advanced features, such as:

Styling: Incorporating CSS to improve the visual design and layout.
Interactivity: Adding JavaScript to introduce interactive elements and dynamic content.
Responsiveness: Making the site responsive to ensure it looks great on all devices.
Updated Images: Replacing placeholder images with actual project visuals.
